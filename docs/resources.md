## Glossary

code golf

: An approach to problem-solving in programming in which the quality of a solution---assuming it satisfies the functional requirements---is assessed almost entirely by code brevity, rather than by runtime efficiency, code clarity, etc. Most (but not all) of those who employ this approach do so as recreation, or for mental exercise.

minimum-threshold programming test

: A type of relatively simple programming test that may given to candidates for entry- or mid-level positions. Successful completion of such a test isn't generally interpreted to mean that the candidate is qualified; however, failure to complete the test successfully is usually taken as an indicator that the candidate is unqualified.
